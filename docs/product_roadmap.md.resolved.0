# Product Roadmap: Language Learning Assistant (Desktop Edition)

## 🌟 Vision
To evolve from a **"Video-to-Doc Productivity Tool"** into an **"Immersive Desktop Language Learning Platform"**, empowering users to turn any video content into a personalized, interactive language lesson.

---

## 📅 Phase 1: Interactive Immersion (The "Player" Update)
**Goal:** Keep the learning loop *inside* the app. Stop the "Alt-Tab" jumping between media player and Word doc.

### ✨ Features
- [ ] **Native Video/Audio Player**:
    - Embed a video player directly in the UI (via `python-vlc` or `mpv`).
    - Support playback controls, speed adjustment (0.5x - 2.0x), and auto-pause.
- [ ] **Interactive Subtitles Sidebar**:
    - Display AI-generated subtitles synchronized with playback.
    - Click-to-seek: Click a subtitle line to jump video to that timestamp.
- [ ] **"On-Demand" AI Tutor**:
    - Instead of pre-generating a whole document, users click a sentence to get:
        - Instant Grammar Analysis.
        - Vocabulary breakdown.
- [ ] **Project Library (SQLite Integration)**:
    - Save processed videos to a local database.
    - "Continue Learning" dashboard to resume previous videos without re-processing.

### 🛠 Technical Enablers
- Integrate `sqlite3` for local data persistence.
- Implement `python-vlc` bindings for CustomTkinter.
- Refactor UI to `Library` vs `Player` view architecture.

## 📅 Phase 2: Knowledge Assets (The "Retention" Update)
**Goal:** Help users retain what they learn. Turn data into personal knowledge assets.

### ✨ Features
- [ ] **Smart Vocabulary Notebook**:
    - "One-click Add": specific words from subtitles to a personal vocab list.
    - Context preservation: Saves the original sentence + audio clip with the word.
- [ ] **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**:
    - Built-in flashcard review session (SuperMemo-2 algorithm).
    - "Review before you watch": Prompt to review due cards before starting a new video.
- [ ] **Learning Analytics**:
    - Heatmap of learning activity (Day/Week).
    - Stats: "Words learned", "Hours listened".

### 🛠 Technical Enablers
- Database schema expansion for `UserVocab` and `ReviewLogs`.
- Flashcard UI component generation.

---

## 📅 Phase 3: Freedom & Privacy (The "Offline" Update)
**Goal:** Remove cost barriers and internet dependencies.

### ✨ Features
- [ ] **100% Offline Mode**:
    - Text-to-Speech & Translation without API keys.
- [ ] **Privacy-First**:
    - Guarantee no data leaves the machine.
- [ ] **Real-time Microphone Mode (Shadowing)**:
    - Dictation practice with real-time feedback.

### 🛠 Technical Enablers
- **Local Whisper**: Integrate `faster-whisper` for GPU-accelerated local transcription.
- **Local LLM**: Connector for `Ollama` (Llama3/Qwen/Mistral) for offline translation.

## 📝 Immediate Next Steps (Q1 2025)

1. **Tech Spike**: Create a "Hello World" video player inside a CustomTkinter window.
2. **Database Init**: Set up `learning.db` sqlite database.
3. **UI Refactor**: Split [gui_fluent.py](file:///c:/Users/hancao/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/language-learner/gui_fluent.py) into multiple view classes.
